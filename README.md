# templatedpythonpractice

A collection of well-indexed, pre-commented 
(or obsessively commented) exercise files for the 'Challenge programs' in Python3 
meant for submissions(or assignments/general practice) towards Tim Buchakla's course
'Python Masterclass'

This repository is not authorised by Tim Buchalka himself.
Therefore, I also take no credit/claim of any kind for this work.

This is only meant as a helping template for fellow students like myself or fisrt-time learners,
so that they only have to clone the entire repository as is
and add content/code between the comments.

You don't need to worry about:

1 The sequences in which the files are saved 
(because all filenames start with a numerical index in the chronology of the occurence of their challenge problems)

2 Creating and saving the files under different names in an exact folder location
(The chore of navigating to a directory or creating one during setup is eliminated.
Also, all filenames are self explanatory)

3 Creating a github repo to track your programming progress via the Github activity tracker
(You could just fork this repository)

4 Watering down of the challenges
(No answers are provided.)

All this so you can save time and dive right into what matters - the code.

P.S.: Because these are empty templates, I guess they probably won't serve as much 
      apart from an alternative setup for the course if you have a Python3 compatible IDE.
      Due care has been taken to not disclose contents from what seems to be 
      a painstakingly made tutorial series.
